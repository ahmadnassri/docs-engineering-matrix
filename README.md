# Competency & Skill Matrix

## Why

In order to foster skill growth and guide team members to improve themselves and others, we document a set of core skills & competencies that each team member needs to have or achieve in order to be effective.

## What

The skills are broken down into three categories, and separated by seniority level _(Junior, Intermediate, Senior, Architect, Manager)_:

- [Technical Health](./tech.md)
- [Product Health](./product.md)
- [Team Health](./team.md)

## How

As part of quarterly reviews, the team's manager will collaborate with each member, and provide **score & feedback** on what's working, what's not, and where to focus next.
